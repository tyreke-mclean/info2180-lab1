 <h2>Tyreke McLean</h2>
 <p>As the haeder suggests, my name is Tyreke. I'm a second year student, majoring in Marine Biology and a minor in Computer Science. Web development peeks my interest, since it allows me to be creative and express myself; at least I hope it will. What I want to do with my degree is to take as much practical skills I can to: educate, research and display content on a large scale platform, without worrying about the costs to hire another party. </p>
